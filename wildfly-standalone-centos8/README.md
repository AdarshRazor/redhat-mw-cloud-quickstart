## Solution Overview

This template creates a standalone node of WildFly on CentOS VM of Standard F1 size (users can select the size of the VM from the dropdown options) in your Resource Group (RG) which includes a Public DNS name, Virtual Network and Network Security Group. It is ideal for development and testing of enterprise Java applications on Azure.

WildFly is an open-source application server runtime that is exceptionally fast, flexible, lightweight and powerful. It is Jakarta EE 8 Full Platform and Web Profile compatible.  The state-of-the-art architecture built on the Modular Service Container enables services on-demand when your application requires them.
