## Solution Overview

JBoss EAP is an open source platform for highly transactional, web-scale Java applications. EAP combines the familiar and popular Jakarta EE specifications with the latest technologies, like Microprofile, to modernize your applications from traditional Java EE into the new world of DevOps, cloud, containers, and microservices. EAP includes everything needed to build, run, deploy, and manage enterprise Java applications in a variety of environments, including on-premise, virtual environments, and in private, public, and hybrid clouds.

This template deploys a web applicaton deployed on JBoss EAP 7.2 running on RHEL 8. 

To obtain a rhsm account go to: www.redhat.com and sign in.
